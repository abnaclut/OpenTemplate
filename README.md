This will be an OpenGL | GLAD template generator (other options will be added dor release, probably) when finished.

This project is made to speed up development of desktop apps. So that developers can spend more time on adding content, rather than having to implement their own graphics. Whether it is through using Qt, reimplementing OpenGL or other similar tools. The goal of the project is to make a light utility with good enough functionality to be useful for quick development of C++ applications.

--NOTE: This is an early stage of the project, so dont expect something useful just yet, I will make it useful when all the backend is finished, untill then I will not make an interface or proper docs so it is finished sooner--

(currently, will include more features in the future)
I know there are programming languages like Python, with tons of libraries, made specifically for the purpose of quick development, I dont like Python for it is interpreted and very slow.
