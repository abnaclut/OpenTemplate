Will be an OpenGL | GLAD template generator with several renderers when finished.

This project is made to speed up development of small applications so that developers can spend more time on adding content. Rather than having to implement their own graphics, whether it is through using Qt or other similar tools. The goal of the project is to make a light utility with good enough functionality to be useful.

(currently, will include more features in the future)
