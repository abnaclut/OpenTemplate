Will be an OpenGL | GLAD template generator with several renderers when finished.

This project is made to speed up development of small applications so that developers can spend more time on adding content. Rather than having to implement their own graphics, whether it is through using Qt or other similar tools. The goal of the project is to make a light utility with good enough functionality to be useful.

--NOTE: This is an early stage of the project, so dont expect something useful just yet, I will make it useful when all the backend is finished, untill then I will not make an interface or proper docs so it is finished sooner--

(currently, will include more features in the future)
